**GridSearchCV for EachType. [LB > -1.0]**  
posted in Predicting Molecular Properties 22 days ago  
In this competition many decisions must be made based on the type of atoms. Modeling for each type proved to be very effective. I jumped from -0.85 to -0.924 with this strategy. (Kernel link). Now, I jumped to -1.0, using the same idea, but this time, adjusting the model parameters for each type of atom. I made a kernel that exemplifies how this technique can be used. The Kernel uses GridSearchCV to fetch the best parameters.
